# decision-maker :deciduous_tree:

Decision-makers under uncertainty. They were made as two my university laboratory works.<br/>

- [decision-maker-1.py](decision-maker-1.py) supports Wald, Savage, Hurwitz, optimism, and pessimism criterions.
- [decision-maker-2.py](decision-maker-2.py) supports Bayes, Bernoulli-Laplace, Hodge-Lehmann, and Germeier
  criterions. <br/>

## Setup:

Specify the strategies and environments states in a CSV file, the examples for both decision-makers are shown in
the [data-1.csv](data-1.csv) and [data-2.csv](data-2.csv). And run the script you
need: [decision-maker-1.py](decision-maker-1.py) or [decision-maker-2.py](decision-maker-2.py).

## Script execution

The example is shown for the first [decision-maker-1.py](decision-maker-1.py), but both scripts work in the same
way.<br/>
Use `python decision-maker-1.py 'your-data-file.csv'` to run the script.<br/>
When the application is running, you will see such menu:

`Available strategies:`<br/>
`1. Wald criterion`<br/>
`2. optimism criterion`<br/>
`3. pessimism criterion`<br/>
`4. Hurwitz criterion`<br/>
`5. Savage criterion`<br/>

Choose the option you like and the script will find a strategy according to the criterion you chose.
